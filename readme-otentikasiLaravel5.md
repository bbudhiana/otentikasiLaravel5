## Laravel 5 with Otentikasi Code (in english : Authentication)

Laravel 5 is one of best php framework. In my opinion, this framework do a lot of complex functional with simple approach.
Actually, before i learn laravel, i choose Codeigniter for doing my everyday work and that framework satisfy me a lot,
until they came with bad information, which that framework would not continued (deprecated).

Okey then... live must go on, i must switch fast to learn other framework, and continue to observation :

- Zend : to complex to me, i really confuse about their explanation, i am to stupid to learn this framework
- Symfony : good framework, but i feel 'rigid', i lost flexibility to explore my idea to the code.
- Laravel 4 : good framework, but i feel not right when you 'bind' everything in one time
- Laravel 5 : my choice that fit everything aspect i need.

Wow... but wait, how about everything i do in Codeigniter, such as Authentication Modul, oke then here we are
Laravel 5 with Otentikasi Code (Otentikasi is indonesian language for 'Authentication').

I use tank-auth when using authentication system in Codeigniter, On this occasion i appreciate and thank to
Ilya Konyukhov (http://konyukhov.com/soft/tank_auth/). This authentication system with laravel 5, basically use
tank-auth authentication for CI.
